üîê Password Manager
A secure, local password manager with a user-friendly web interface built using Python and Streamlit. All data is encrypted locally and never leaves your machine.
Your master password is never stored. It is used to generate an in-memory encryption key that securely locks and unlocks your password vault. Without it, your data is unreadable.
Secure Encryption: Uses a master password to encrypt the entire vault with PBKDF2 and Fernet encryption. 

Local-First Storage: Your encrypted vault is stored safely on your computer in a password_manager.db file.
